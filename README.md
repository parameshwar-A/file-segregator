# file-segregator

A GUI for segregating files based on their extension

This is a simple file segregator application which is written in python using sys package.
The source code of the application is a long one. (Not clean code :) ).
This was written by myself(Parameshwar Arunachalam) as a small milestone project while learning basic packages and tkinter.

If you want to work on it, Just fork it and have fun.

Also if you find any bugs please let me know here or you can [mail me](mailto:parameshwar273@gmail.com)
